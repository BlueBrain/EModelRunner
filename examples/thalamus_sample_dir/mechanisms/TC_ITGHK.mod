TITLE Low threshold calcium current
:
:   Ca++ current responsible for low threshold spikes (LTS)
:   Differential equations
:
:   Model of Huguenard & McCormick, J Neurophysiol 68: 1373-1383, 1992.
:   The kinetics is described by Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equations,
:   using a m2h format, according to the voltage-clamp data
:   (whole cell patch clamp) of Huguenard & Prince, J. Neurosci. 
:   12: 3804-3817, 1992.
:
:   This model is described in detail in:
:   Destexhe A, Neubig M, Ulrich D and Huguenard JR.  
:   Dendritic low-threshold calcium currents in thalamic relay cells.  
:   Journal of Neuroscience 18: 3574-3588, 1998.

:    - shift parameter for screening charge
:    - empirical correction for contamination by inactivation (Huguenard)

:   The activation functions were estimated by John Huguenard.
:   The V_1/2 were of -57 and -81 in the vclamp simulations, 
:   and -60 and -84 in the current clamp simulations.
:
:   The activation function were empirically corrected in order to account
:   for the contamination of inactivation.  Therefore the simulations 
:   using these values reproduce more closely the voltage clamp experiments.
